SPAWNER 2019.9

<p>
<i>This AddOn allows you to spawn Monsters dynamically into your scene. This saves you from
placing dozens of Monsters inside your game world by hand and helps you
distributing and populating your gameworld.</i>

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
Some UCE AddOns require other AddOns to be installed first in order to work properly:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following AddOns(s):
<pre>
<code><a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-tools.html" target="_blank">UCE Tools</a></code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/scripting-define-symbols/">HERE</a>).
<br><br>
This AddOn uses the following define(s):
<pre>
<code>Uses no Defines</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Core Changes</h3>
<p>
Many AddOns require changes to the uMMORPG3d core scripts in order to function. The most common core changes are listed in a extra ReadMe contained in the UCE Tools AddOn (see <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_required-core-changes.html">HERE</a>). The changes for this AddOn are repeated below as well:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following core change(s):

<h3>Additional Information</h3>


<p><b>Start Spawner - </b> a simple spawner that triggers only once when the server is launched. This is useful to pre-populate your areas and can also be used to spawn scenery (as long as it's a network identity game object).</p>

<p><b>Fixed Spawner - </b> another simple spawner that triggers, when a player enters the spawning area. It spawns a fixed number of objects at a fixed position each. Can be used for almost anything including Monsters and even NPCs (to dynamically populate towns).</p>

<p><b>Mob Spawner - </b> the most versatile spawner and intended to be used for monster spawns. Spawns a random number of random game objects at a random position within the spawn areas radius.</p>

<p><b>Wave Spawner - </b> the most complex and CPU/RAM intense spawner. Similar to the mob spawner but can also spawn configureable "waves" of enemies in a row. Ideal for quests and boss fights, just don't use too many of them in one scene.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>More Wave Spawner Details:</b></li>
<li>You can basically spawn any kind of prefab with this AddOn, but it is recommended
to only spawn prefabs that are based on the uMMORPG entity class (e.g. Monsters).</li>
<li>All spawnable prefabs must be added to your NetworkManager spawnable prefabs list
first. Go to your scene, NetworkManager, its inspector and check the spawnable
prefabs list.</li>
<li>In the Inspector: Make sure to check either "triggerOnServerLaunch" or "triggerOnPlayerEnter" or both. Also make sure your object list does contain objects and that those objects are
in the spawnable prefabs list of your network manager.</li>
<li>You can also spawn monsters at a different location when entering an area. See "spawn destinations" in the inspector. Those targets should be UCE spawn areas or any game object with a sphere collider on it (as the script requires a <b>radius</b> to work properly).</li>
<li>It is possible to create waves of spawns as well, even with trigger conditions.</li>
<li>Edit all other settings to your liking, see hover tooltips for more information.</li>
</ul>
