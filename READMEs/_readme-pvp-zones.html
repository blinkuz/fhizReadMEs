PVP ZONES & REALMS 2019.7
</h1>

<p>
<i>
Add various PVP types to your game and limit the regions where PVP combat can take place!<br>
<ul>
<li>Open PVP where everybody can attack anybody</li>
<li>Guild PVP where members of different guilds can attack each other</li>
<li>Realm PVP where members of different realms can attack each other</li>
<li>Or any mix of the above</li>
</ul>
You can also add Realms to your Entities and create allied or hostile nations that way.
When setup properly, you can create guards that defend one realm but attack others and many more interesting things.

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
Some UCE AddOns require other AddOns to be installed first in order to work properly:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following AddOns(s):
<pre>
<code><a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-tools.html" target="_blank">UCE Tools</a></code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/scripting-define-symbols/">HERE</a>).
<br><br>
This AddOn uses the following define(s):
<pre>
<code>_FHIZPVP</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Core Changes</h3>
<p>
Many AddOns require changes to the uMMORPG3d core scripts in order to function. The most common core changes are listed in a extra ReadMe contained in the UCE Tools AddOn (see <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_required-core-changes.html">HERE</a>). The changes for this AddOn are repeated below as well:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following core change(s):

<h2>INSTALLATION PROCESS</h2>

<h3>Integration Steps</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>[Required] Add the "UCE_Area_PVPZone" to your scene, edit it in the inspector. PvP combat is only possible within such an area from now on.</li>
<li>[Note] Players, Pets and Monsters now have a Realm as well as allied Realm (Ally).</li>
<li>[Required] You have to set a different Realms for Monsters and Players or they will not be able to attack each other.</li>
<li>[Optional] EXAMPLE: Set the bandit prefab to "Elf", the skeleton prefab to "Undead" and the players to "Human" to test. You can leave all allied realms empty for now.</li>
<li>[Optional] EXAMPLE: To add NPC guards of a specific realm, use a monster as a base and set both of it's Realms to the same as the players of that realm.</li>
<li>[Required] Go to: File -> Player -> Physics<br>
See the Layer Collission Matrix and check the box on row "Monster" at column "Ignore Raycast"<br>
Monsters attack each other now when set to Aggressive and of non-matching realms.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<i>

<ul>

<li>By default, this AddOn will DISABLE all PVP combat. You have to place a PVPRegion
Collider in your scene to make certain types of PVP combat available within that collider.</li>

<li>Both the Realm and the alliedRealm of Monsters and Players should be different, otherwise
you won't be able to attack them.</li>
<li>If you leave both Realm and Ally empty the Entity will be completely neutral and attackable by all / can attack all.</li>
<li>Only "aggressive" monster will attack on their own.</li>
<li>"Neutral" monsters will only strikeback but never attack on their on. They also do so only when attack by an enemy who is not of the same Realm ID.</li>
<li>"Pacifistic" monsters never attack and never strike back.</li>

<li>See that little "Captureable" option in the Monster inspector? Check that and when
the monster is set to "respawn", it will do so and convert to the Realm of the player
who killed it. Combine that with a guard tower that rises again, allied to the player who dealt the final blow.</li>

<li>It is recommended to always corner-off your PVP Regions and connect them to
other Regions in your scene via a teleporter. If you put a non-PVP region close to a
PVP Region, weird things can happen. Players inside a PVP Region might be able to shoot
at players outside the Region etc.</li>

</ul>
