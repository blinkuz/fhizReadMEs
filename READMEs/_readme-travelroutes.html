TRAVELROUTES 2019.4
</h1>

<p><i>
This AddOn will add a discoverable teleporter network to your game. Using the Travelroutes you
can create a travel system like the Gryphon network found in World of Warcraft. Players
can discover new travelroutes and can teleport to travelroutes they already discovered.
<br><br>
&middot; Travelroutes use a Collider and not an NPC, which results in low overhead.<br>
&middot; Add any amount of Unlockroutes to the collider - those routes will be discovered on enter.<br>
&middot; The routes a player discovered are permanently saved in the database.<br>
&middot; Add any number of Travelroutes to the collider - those routes are the destinations the
player can teleport to.<br>
&middot; A player can only teleport to destinations he or she already discovered beforehand.<br>
&middot; Players can gain an amount of experience the first time they discover a new travelroute.<br>
&middot; Set a gold cost per unit when teleporting.<br>
&middot; The final gold cost is calculated from the distance of the location and the destination.<br>
&middot; Players get notified with a popup window on their client, when a new travelroute becomes available

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
Some UCE AddOns require other AddOns to be installed first in order to work properly:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following AddOns(s):
<pre>
<code><a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-tools.html" target="_blank">UCE Tools</a></code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/scripting-define-symbols/">HERE</a>).
<br><br>
This AddOn uses the following define(s):

<code>_FHIZTRAVEL</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Core Changes</h3>
<p>
Many AddOns require changes to the uMMORPG3d core scripts in order to function.

<h2>INSTALLATION PROCESS</h2>

<h3>Integration Steps</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>[Required] Add everything in the "UI [Drag to Canvas]" folder to your Canvas</li>
<li>[Required] Add one or more "UCE Area Travelroute Box" area to your Scene</li>
<li>[Required] On that travelroute Area, edit the travelable as well as the unlockable routes.</li>
<li>[Optional] A route must be "unlocked" before it can be "travelled" to.</li>
<li>[Note] You use the same "UCE Area Travelroute Box" for both "unlocking" and "travelling".</li>
<li>[Note] Unlocking and remembering Travelroutes is done according to their name (thats either the target Transforms name or the off Scene name)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p><i>

<b>Important note:</b> A players discovered Travelroutes are saved in the database according to their name. This means there cannot be two travelroutes with the same name or they will conflict. In addition, off Scene travelroutes are saved according to their Scene's name. This means you can only have ONE travelroute to the other scene, if you have multiple, they will conflict. Its best to have just 1 Travelroute to the other scene and then have on scene travelroutes again.
