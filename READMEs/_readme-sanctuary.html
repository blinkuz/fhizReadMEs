SANCTUARY 2019.2
</h1>

<p>
<i>This addon allows you to add one or more Sanctuaries to your scenes. A Sanctuary is a
area that allows your players to recover while being offline (like a Inn, Camp or Restplace).
<br><br>
After your players logged-out, while inside a Sanctuary, they will recover their stats and
even gain stats the longer they stay offline. You can adjust the recovery and gain rates
(as well as maximums) in the Inspector settings of the Sanctuary, once you placed it in
your scene.</i></p>

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
Some UCE AddOns require other AddOns to be installed first in order to work properly:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following AddOns(s):
<pre>
<code><a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-tools.html" target="_blank">UCE Tools</a></code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/scripting-define-symbols/">HERE</a>).
<br><br>
This AddOn uses the following define(s):
<pre>
<code>Uses no Defines</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Core Changes</h3>
<p>
Many AddOns require changes to the uMMORPG3d core scripts in order to function. The most common core changes are listed in a extra ReadMe contained in the UCE Tools AddOn (see <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_required-core-changes.html">HERE</a>). The changes for this AddOn are repeated below as well:

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p><i>

Logging out inside a Sanctuary allows your players to:
<br><br>
* Recover Health while being offline<br>
* Recover Mana while being offline<br>
* Gain Skill Experience while being offline (with an optional cap)<br>
* Gain Experience while being offline (with an optional cap)<br>
* Gain Gold while being offline (with an optional cap)<br>
* Gain Coins while being offline (with an optional cap)<br>
<br><br>
You can mix all attributes as you wish, so a Sanctuary can provide some or all of the
rates stated above. You can also have several Sanctuaries in your scene, each one with
individual settings (like a Inn where player recover Health/Mana while being offline or
a Goldmine where players earn gold while being offline etc.).
<br><br>
Simply set a rating to 0 to disable it.
<br><br>
Each rating refers to the number of seconds that must pass in order to grant the player
+1 of the given stat (eg. SecondsPerHealth = 60 means the player recovers 1 health per
60 seconds while being offline).
