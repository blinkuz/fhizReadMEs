MOUNTS 2019.3
</h1>

<p>
<i>This AddOn adds a complex Mount system to uMMORPG3d, that will allow players to ride mounts and travel the map at increased speed. Mounts are summoned by using a special item and can be unsummonend using that item as well. Mounts also come with various options and are able to attack enemies while unmounted.</i>

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
Some UCE AddOns require other AddOns to be installed first in order to work properly:
<br><br>
This AddOn requires the following AddOns(s):
<pre>
<code><a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-tools.html" target="_blank">UCE Tools</a>, <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_readme-pvp-zones.html" target="_blank">UCE PvP Zones & Realms (optional)</a></code>

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/scripting-define-symbols/">HERE</a>).
<br><br>
This AddOn uses the following define(s):
<pre>
<code>_FHIZMOUNTS</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Core Changes</h3>
<p>
Many AddOns require changes to the uMMORPG3d core scripts in order to function. The most common core changes are listed in a extra ReadMe contained in the UCE Tools AddOn (see <a href="https://indie-mmo.net/addon-readmes/_required-core-changes.html">HERE</a>). The changes for this AddOn are repeated below as well:

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mounts are bound to special Mount items, you can create those items via the context menu.</li>
<li>Each mount consists of 2 game objects, you have to create a game object for both: The <b>unmounted mount</b> as well as the <b>mounted mount</b>. You should use the provided example mounts as a base.
<li>Mounts have stats, you can easily edit them in the inspector. Check the inspector settings for more details. Only unmounted mounts have combat stats, as mounted mounts do not participate in combat.</li>
<li>Unmounted mounts follow their owner around, just like pets, you can edit the settings in the inspector as well.</li>
<li>Only unmounted mounts can participate in combat, make sure to edit the Collision layer matrix as described above or they wont react. Also edit their stats in the inspector.</li>
<li>Mounts cannot gain experience or level up, but you can create multiple mount items and multiple mount game objects to create stronger variants.</li>
<li><b>Attention: This feature also requires my PVPZones AddOn installed:</b> It is possible to allow players to attack and use skills while being mounted, but you can also dis-allow that on a per-skill basis. In order to do so, you have to check the "uncastable while mounted" checkbox that now appears next each skill.
<li>Be sure to check out the various options of Mounted Mounts, in order to make them move faster, optionally hide the player model, unmount the player when hit and more!</li>
