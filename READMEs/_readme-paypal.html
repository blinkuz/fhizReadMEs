<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This complex AddOn will add PayPal as payment gateway to your game. This allows you to charge your players for in game purchases with real currency. Purchases are customizable and contain coins, gold, experience as well as items. The system is relieable and fraud safe.

<h3>Scripting Defines</h3>
<p>
Most UCE AddOns use "Scripting Defines" that are added automatically on import. Sometimes you might be required to manually add or remove such a define. In that case, locate your defines list and remove the define (including the semicolon ; at the end). You find defines in your project here: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player - > Scripting Define Symbols (you can learn more about Defines <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/scripting-define-21320336">HERE</a>).
<br><br>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p><i>Important Note:</i><br>
<b>Using this AddOn will get your game kicked from all major app stores, as they don't tolerate third party payment providers.</b>
</p>

<p><i>Important Note:</i><br>
This AddOn requires a PayPal Developer account, which is free and easy to setup.
</p>

<p><i>Important Note:</i><br>
By default, SANDBOX mode is enabled, you can change that before releasing a client for production. Your test email will only work while in sandbox mode.

<p><i>Important Note:</i><br>
By default your purchasers are forwared to the google homepage after making their transaction, you can change that to another website by editing the data in:
<pre><code>Assets\Store\Resources\Misc\CreatePaymentRequestBody.json
</code></pre>
It makes sense to forward to a special page on the homepage of your game to show them that their transaction is finished.
<br><br>
Your players should then switch back to the Unity project (the game itself) and wait a bit for the confirmation to arrive. Then they will be awarded their coins, gold, experience and items. During the next server save, the coins are safely deposited in the database of the server as well.
